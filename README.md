## Acknowledgments

Thanks to this man [@Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell), I watched his youtube on how he solved this challenge and I get some ideas because of him like it is important to put any variable on `:root` that can affect the whole website like `fonts-size` `font-family` `colors` and many important things.
